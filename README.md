I built this while learning the MERN stack as a part of my ICSI 518 Software Engineering class at UAlbany. This project consists of a series of gradual assignments designed to help you learn the MERN stack step-by-step. Each assignment builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts and techniques to enhance your understanding of full-stack development.
