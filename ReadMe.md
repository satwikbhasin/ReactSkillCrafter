Developed as part of my journey to learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project incorporates various functionalities:

### Backend: 
  - Powered by Express.js
  - Handles API calls and database interactions

### Frontend: 
  - Crafted with React.js
  - Provides a dynamic user interface with real-time updates

### Database:
  - MongoDB used for data storage and retrieval

### Deployment:
  - Originally deployed on Amazon EC2, now migrated to Render for hosting
  - Main branch equipped with Docker for easy containerization of the application
  - Deployment-render branch tailored for Render, ensuring compatibility and smooth deployment

As this deployment is free, the backend servers automatically spin down when not in use. Consequently, there may be a brief delay in fetching response from backend such as retrieving products but the servers start back up upon receiving a request.
